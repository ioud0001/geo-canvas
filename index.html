<p>Nah actually all I am doing is taking your GPS coordinates and linking to a Google Maps image, and displaying a red dot at your exact location.</p>
<p>I can assure you that this information is not being tracked (check the JavaScript if you don't believe me...), so enjoy the GPS feature, and try it on your mobile device and compare the coordinates. You may notice some differences! </p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this feature. </p>
